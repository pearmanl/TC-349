The Michigan State University site is a place flowing with information for people of all different types, so it needs to be well organized.  The website does a good job of sorting it’s information.  You can divide what information you want to view by selecting yourself as a student, faculty member, alumni and donor, business or visitor.  You can also divide it based on admission, academics, research, global, engagement or athletics.  This makes it easy for people who have never seen the site to narrow down all the information thrown at them and decide what portion of the site is geared towards them.
 	The visual design of the site is a bit busy, but not disorganized.  Everything is in a logical place, there is just so much information that it’s overwhelming to look at.  Depending on the part of the site that you are looking at, it is either only a very simple layout created only with text, or it is a visual experience, trying to encourage people to get excited about Michigan State.  I think that it creates a good balance for providing information when it’s needed and drawing in people to the site.
