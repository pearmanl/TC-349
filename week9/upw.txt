United pixelworkers is an overall well designed site with just a few minor details that need to be tweaked.  The site is obviously geared towards a young audience because of it’s casual language and trendy look.  It uses a patriotic color scheme and keeps the background simple so that it doesn’t distract from the site’s main content.  The web page has a simple navigation with only a few sections to choose from, and in general, all the text is clear and concise.  
 	One issue I found with the site is the link “Pixelivery” in the navigation.  Pixelivery is not a common word, and it wont make sense to everyone who comes across the site.  Even if you click on the Pixelivery link, there is no explanation as to what that section of the site is.  As a user who doesn’t know what that word means, I probably wouldn’t go to that section of the site at all, and even if I did, I would probably give up on it after not finding an explanation.  Also, there is no consistent search bar across all the pages, when it does appear on one of the pages, it is gigantic and confusing.
