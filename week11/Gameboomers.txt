For my mobile site, I chose to look at Gameboomers.com.  I could not use xcode to test it, because it’s not compatible with my version of mac, but I used an online iphone emulator which seemed to work quite well.  I think that Gameboomers did a very good job of making their mobile site.  Whether flipped vertical or horizontal, I found that the site readjusted and maintained good proportions.  No parts of the site were cut off, and all the images and links were fully functional.  
 	They used a 3 panel layout for their site which was nicely distributed correctly, even on the iphone.  All their images maintained a reasonable size while still being small enough to fit on the iphone’s screen.  When flipped vertical, the site’s text did appear to be a bit too small, but my guess is that on a real iphone, zooming in and out would be functional.  When it was flipped horizontal, the font size looked great, and the page rescaled it’s width to fit it’s new constraints.  Overall, I think they did a great job of creating a functional mobile site.
