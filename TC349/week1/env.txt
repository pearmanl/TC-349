 	For my text editor, I chose a program called TextWrangler.  I chose this text editor because I am not very experienced with coding and I found it to be very simple to customize and clear to understand.  It gives me options to hide or show line numbers, the ability to minimize segments of code, and the ability to easily open and work within a project folder.  It is not a complicated program, it is very simple which it needs to be.  I don’t think a text editor particularly needs a lot of gadgets and settings to change.  I’ve taken a web design class using dreamweaver before, and I barely learned anything, because the program does so much for you.  This editor gives me the ability to freely write text and actually learn.   
 	     Really, this text editor is virtually exactly the same as textmate, but I ended up choosing this one, because I liked the way it chose to highlight and color the code that I wrote.  Since I am a beginner with coding, I often rely on my code to change color to let me know that I am doing it right.  Textmate does that sometimes, but TextWrangler does it more.  I think it makes TextWrangler the best text editor for me.
