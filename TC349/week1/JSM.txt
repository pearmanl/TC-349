 JSM WEBSITE CRITIQUE
 Loralee Pearman
 
 Jason Santa Maria’s site is clean cut and easily navigable while still leaving space for a little modern artistic flair.  There is a good balance of images and text as well as use of empty space.   I think the basicness of the site makes it easy to quickly zone in on what I am looking for.  It is divided up into 5 basic sections that help me narrow down what I’m looking for almost instantly, and it displays his logo and name at the top, which also doubles as a home button.  These features are things that are often assumed on web pages, and big red flags when they are absent. 
 	All the links and buttons are created so they switch colors when you scroll over them, which help to make it clear where exactly you are navigating to.  The text is easy to read, but it still fits within the theme of the site, adding to the aesthetic, but making it easy to read what you need to.  My only possible criticism is the location of the links to his twitter and other websites.  They are located way at the bottom of the page, and aren’t initially visible on any of the pages.  If someone were to just briefly glance at his page, they would not see it.  I think the top of the page would be a better place to put it, because people will be guaranteed to see it when they reach the page.  
 	Overall, I think the site is very well put together.  It is easy to navigate and pretty to look at.  It manages to show off his artistic flair as a designer while still maintaining the functionality needed for a web page
