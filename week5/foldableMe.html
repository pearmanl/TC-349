	<h2> My Card Sort Findings </h2>
	<p>For the foldable me card sort, I sorted my cards slightly differently.  Rather than having a blog section, I changed it to a news section.  I figured that a blog was an extra personal sight they could link people to on the about us page, but people would go to the news page to see what was currently happening that was relevant, not just random blog posts.  I also made a checkout section where you could go to pay and learn about payment options and orders you had made in the past.  
 	</p>
 	<p> I found that people had different opinions about whether facebook, pinterest site feedback twitter went under contact us or about us.  I personally placed site feedback under about us, and after seeing people place it in contact us, I realized that was a much more practical place.  There was also some disagreement on whether the features of the site should be listed in about me or in the build your character section.  I intended it to be in the build your character section listing the different features you could use there, but it seems like it would also be smart to list some of the siteâ€™s cool features under about us to inform people who are just stopping in to look. </p>
