The first thing I noticed about Chartbeat is that it lacks a real navigation.  Chartbeat only has two options listed on the top of the page – Demo and “looking for newsbeat?”  All the information on the product was scattered about the main page in a jumble of unclear information.  It’s hard to take in so much information when the font is so large that the whole picture is hidden down on the page and nothing is divided into sections for you.  
 	The page has a pretty design and nice graphics, but other than being visually nice, it isn’t a very practical sight.  I found that even after scrolling through the page several times, I didn’t have a clear idea of what the product was being advertised on the site.  I found it irritating to look at the overly large text and try to take in all the information when it was so far spread out.  Overall, I think that Chartbeat is a site that isn’t practical for selling a product.  It look nice visually, but as a place to get information about a product, it is lacking.
