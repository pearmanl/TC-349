	<h2>My Card Sort Findings</h2>
	<p>
	I did an online card sort for my portfolio website by sending a link out to some friends on facebook.  For my portfolio, I created 3 index pages – about me, archive and projects.  I was surprised to find that one of my friends actually added their own “contact me” section.  I was planning on placing all my contact information under the about me section to make the site more minimal and straightforward.  The fact that they added that extra section makes me think that maybe I will need it.

	 	I found a bit of confusion about whethere different works of art should fall under the archive section or the project section.  Some people seemed to consider the projects section to be a sort of news section where I gave current updates on the projects I was still working on.  When I made that section, I considered it to be more of a place where I would place pretty much everything I have done unless it was really old but still notable.  I will have to put a lot of consideration into what goes where for the final project.
