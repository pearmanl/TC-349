<h2>Loralee's Bio</h2> 
<p>
Loralee Pearman is a Junior from Niles, Michigan, currently studying Video Game design at Michigan State University.  She was first drawn to the industry by a childhood spent playing adventure games, mmorpgs and rpgs.  Mixed with her passion for art in all forms and her love for storytelling, she knew that game art was the way to go.  Loralee’s main focus in the field is 3D modeling and Texturing.  She believes that there is nothing more beautiful and immersive than a well thought out game environment with characters and props to match.
</p>
<p>	Loralee is currently a member of the game design club at MSU, Spartasoft.  There, she has participated in several 48 hour game jams.  She has also been part of a small campus group, Slightly Sirius Games, where she was responsible for character art as well as some environmental art and asset modeling.  She is now currently a part of the game design specialization at Michigan State – a 4 semester span of courses in designing and making games.
</p>
<p>
 	Loralee is a skilled modeler in high or low polycount settings, with some skills in texture painting, uving and 2D art.  In her free time, you will find her currently reading “3D game textures” by Luke Ahearn, a book on creating texture art through photoshop.  Her other passions include playing guitar and writing music and lyrics, drawing and playing video games.

<h2>Panic.com Critique</h2>
<p>Panic.com immediately got my attention with it’s modern style aimed towards a generation of young mobile device owners.  The text written on the homepage “Hi.  We’re Panic….” Speaks to you casually as though to a friend, but I think the artistic and casual atmosphere of the site, created to draw users in, also makes it a bit unclear and messy.
</p>  
<p> 	For starters, the front page is so brief that it takes a moment to understand what is going on with it.  The symbols on the front page are each links to descriptions of apps, and they do little to label where they will lead you.  Once you click on an app, you are lead to its page, which is formatted completely differently, from the other apps pages.  The text and images are so large on some pages that it is hard to really read them or understand how they relate.  On top of that, the pages are completely disorganized; pictures and words span the page with no sort of pattern, sometimes even overlapping each other.  The site is unclear, and aside from the front page, appears almost unfinished. 
</p> 
<p>Overall, panic.com is a messy sight with an unfinished vision.  The artisctic vision and style of the site is entirely killed by its unclear navigation and disorganized setup.
