			<p>Loralee Pearman is a Junior from Niles, Michigan, currently studying Video Game design at Michigan State University.  She was first drawn to the industry by a childhood spent playing adventure games, mmorpgs and rpgs.  Mixed with her passion for art in all forms and her love for storytelling, she knew that game art was the way to go.  Loralee’s main focus in the field is 3D modeling and Texturing.  She believes that there is nothing more beautiful and immersive than a well thought out game environment with characters and props to match.
 	Loralee is currently a member of the game design club at MSU, Spartasoft.  There, she has participated in several 48 hour game jams.  She has also been part of a small campus group, Slightly Sirius Games, where she was responsible for character art as well as some environmental art and asset modeling.  She is now currently a part of the game design specialization at Michigan State – a 4 semester span of courses in designing and making games.
 	Loralee is a skilled modeler in high or low polycount settings, with some skills in texture painting, uving and 2D art.  In her free time, you will find her currently reading “3D game textures” by Luke Ahearn, a book on creating texture art through photoshop.  Her other passions include playing guitar and writing music and lyrics, drawing and playing video games.
