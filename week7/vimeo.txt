I think that Vimeo is an intuitive site that can be navigated with ease.  The site is divided up into simple sections that everyone can understand, and it provides users with a search bar so they can easily navigate to specific videos.  The site is fun and modern which suits the generation that is most known for watching and uploading videos online.   Visually, the site manages to fit in a lot of information in such a way that nothing appears too crowded.  
	A part of Vimeo that makes it so clear to navigate is itâ€™s navigation bar at the top.  Before even clicking to one of the four navigation sections, you can get a drop down menu by hovering over the text.  This gives you a clear idea of what this section will contain, and it also gives you a short description of each subsection.  Rather than getting lost around the site, a user could simply hover over the different navigation elements to decide where they need to be most.  Overall, Vimeo is an efficient site with a young look.  It manages to reach the audience it is made for and make it easy for them to delve into the site.
