Heroku has a clean, sleek interface that houses mounds of information.  The site is highly technical and it gets to be almost overwhelming.  The information on the site is so complex and so widely spread that it is hard to find what you are looking for and understand what you are looking at.  Although the site is organized well visually, the information is not sorted well, which becomes an issue.
	I think that when a site contains so much information, especially technical information, it is important to narrow it down into a small number of easily identifiable categories.  Having the information divided up more fluidly would create a more manageable interface that helps provide information on its products rather than confuse the customers.  It would also help to pick and choose which information is really necessary on the page, and how to simplify the information that is required.
